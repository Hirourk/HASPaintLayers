HAS Paint Layers is a free tool for artists who want a non-destructive workflow with textures. It is especially useful for artists focusing on hand-painted textures and fast editing, while still being highly effective for creating PBR (Physically Based Rendering) textures. It provides layers, paint tools, fast baking, filters, and more.

To get started, download the latest version on releases page https://github.com/Hirourk/HASPaintLayers/releases

Then, open Blender and go to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons. Click on Install and select the downloaded file.

Once installed, you will see the HAS Paint panel in the 3D viewport, ready to use.

Add-on tested on 3.1, 3.6, 4.0, 4.2 Blender versions
